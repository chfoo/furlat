===============================
FURLAT: Find URL Archiving Tool
===============================

Furlat is a tool and library that discovers and analyzes URL shortcodes generated by URL shorteners.


Quick Start
===========

Installation
++++++++++++

You will need:

* Python 3.2 or greater
* Firefox
* Selenium (Python 3 Package)

You can install the dependent Python packages using ``pip``. For example on Ubuntu::

    pip3 install selenium


Running
+++++++

You can run the package as a script::

    python3 -m furlat find bit.ly --verbose

To just search Twitter::

    python3 -m furlat find bit.ly --verbose --source twitter

Use the ``--help`` to see details about arguments.

Results are currently stored into a text file. For example, if you run bit.ly, a folder called ``bitly`` will be created with the text files inside the folder. The text files contain the discovered URLs.

Infinitely running commands check for a sentinel file called ``STOP``. If the modified file is newly modified or created after starting the command, the command will stop gracefully::

    touch STOP


Commands
--------

analyze
    Print statistics about the URL shortcodes

find
    Launch a find URL project

sort
    Sort the URLs by length, then value


Library
+++++++

The library is not yet stable as an API, but you can read the ``__main__.py`` file to get a overview of how it works.


About
=====

The goal of Furlat is to find valid shortcodes as much as possible, without brute-force discovery, using 3rd party sources such as search engines and microblogs.
